# Installation guide

The following installation guides will guide you step-by-step to create a new EverShop project and get it started.

:::info

Please check [this document](/docs/development/getting-started/system-requirements) for the system requirement list.

## Using `create-evershop-app` command
### Without MySQL database(The `playAround` mode) 
You can get started with EverShop in minutes by running the following command:
    
```bash
npx create-evershop-app my-app --playAround
```
With the `--playAround` flag, you don't need to install MySQL database. A MySQL database will be provided to you in our cloud server. So you can get started with EverShop quickly.

:::warning
This database is only for testing purpose. It will be permanently deleted after 7 days. No backup is available. Please DO NOT insert any important data into this database. After 7 days, you will have to install your own MySQL database to continue using EverShop.
