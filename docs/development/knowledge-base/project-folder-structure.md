# Project folder structure

A EverShop project contains node_modules, caching files, configuration files, media and extension. Let’s take a look to the directory structure:

```bash
├── .evershop
├── .log
├── config
│     ├ default.json
├── extensions
├── media
├── node_modules
├── themes
├── package-lock.json
└── package.json

```
## The `.evershop` Folder

This folder contains the built files for production. [ReactJS components](https://reactjs.org/) and assets files will be generated by the [build command](/docs/development/knowledge-base/command-lines) and stay here automatically.

## The `.log` Folder

This folder contains the log file. The log file is where we store the logging information of all the even happening in your application.

## The `config` Folder

This folder contains the configuration files. You can learn more about the configuration in [this document](/docs/development/knowledge-base/configuration-guide).

## The `extensions` Folder

This folder contains modules developed by third-party and developer. Check [this document](../module/extension-development) to understand more the module structure.

## The `media` Folder

This folder contains media files like product images, category images.

## The `node_modules` Folder

This is the default node_modules from [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). It contains the packages from NodeJs and vendors. EverShop core package is also located in this folder.

## The `themes` Folder

This folder contains themes developed by third-party and developer. Check [this document](../theme/theme-overview) for more information.
